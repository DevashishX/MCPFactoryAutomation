## Process Description

The Flexible/Wearable Electronics Assembly process was pioneered by Flex Ltd. in 2014 to enable the emerging market of wearable technology including fitness bands, smartwatches, flexible OLED displays, and electronic textiles integrated into clothing. This innovative process accommodates flexible substrates such as polyimide films, ultra-thin FR-4, and even fabric-based circuits that cannot withstand the thermal and mechanical stresses of traditional rigid PCB assembly. Low-temperature solder paste, typically bismuth-tin alloys with melting points around 138-160°C, minimizes thermal stress that could cause substrate deformation or delamination of flexible materials. The paste application must account for substrate flexibility, often using support fixtures or temporary rigid carriers during printing. Specialized placement equipment features adaptive vacuum nozzles and compliant pick tips that gently handle components without damaging the flexible substrate beneath.

The reflow process maintains strict temperature control at 235°C maximum with carefully managed heating and cooling rates to prevent differential expansion that causes warping in thin, flexible materials. Some implementations use localized heating or selective soldering techniques for ultra-sensitive substrates. The 2D automated optical inspection systems are specially calibrated to accommodate the non-planar nature of flexible circuits, using dynamic focus adjustment and flexible lighting to inspect curved or bent surfaces. Functional testing extends beyond electrical verification to include mechanical flex cycle testing, where assemblies are repeatedly bent to specified radii to ensure solder joints and component attachments maintain integrity through thousands of flex cycles expected during normal wear. This process has enabled revolutionary products like rollable displays, conformal medical patches with integrated sensors, and smart clothing with embedded electronics that conform to body movements while maintaining full functionality.
