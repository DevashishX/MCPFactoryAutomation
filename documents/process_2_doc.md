## Process Description

The High-Reliability Industrial Equipment Assembly process was pioneered by Siemens AG in 1998 to meet the demanding requirements of industrial automation and power distribution systems. This process utilizes leaded solder paste, specifically tin-lead eutectic (63Sn/37Pb), which remains permissible under RoHS exemptions for industrial equipment due to its superior mechanical properties and reliability in harsh operating environments. The paste is applied with precise thickness control to ensure consistent joint formation. High-precision placement systems position components with exceptional accuracy, critical for dense circuit boards containing fine-pitch BGAs, QFPs, and other complex packages used in programmable logic controllers and industrial motor drives.

The soldering phase employs a 245°C peak reflow temperature, higher than consumer electronics processes, to create robust solder joints capable of withstanding extreme temperature cycling, vibration, and mechanical shock common in factory environments. Following reflow, 3D AOI systems capture detailed height and volume measurements of each solder joint, detecting subtle defects that 2D systems might miss, such as insufficient solder volume or coplanarity issues. The final functional testing phase is extensive, involving powered circuit verification under simulated operating conditions including temperature extremes and voltage variations. This rigorous process ensures that industrial control systems, variable frequency drives, and SCADA equipment meet reliability standards exceeding 100,000 hours mean time between failures, making it the preferred methodology for mission-critical industrial applications where downtime costs can exceed thousands of dollars per minute.
