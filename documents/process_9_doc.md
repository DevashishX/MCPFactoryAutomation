## Process Description

The Military/Defense Grade Electronics Assembly process was established by Raytheon Technologies in 2001 to meet the extraordinary reliability and security requirements of defense applications including radar systems, missile guidance, secure communications equipment, and battlefield management systems. This process operates under strict adherence to MIL-STD-883 and MIL-PRF-38534 specifications, utilizing high-reliability leaded solder paste that remains exempt from RoHS restrictions due to its proven superior performance in mission-critical applications. The tin-lead eutectic formulation provides exceptional resistance to tin whisker formation, thermal fatigue, and mechanical shock that could prove catastrophic in defense systems. All materials undergo rigorous qualification testing and maintain complete chain-of-custody documentation. Assembly occurs in controlled-access facilities with security clearances, ensuring protection of classified designs and preventing component counterfeiting or tampering.

The reflow soldering process employs a 260°C peak temperature profile creating robust solder joints capable of surviving extreme environmental conditions from Arctic deployments to desert warfare, withstanding sustained vibration from artillery fire, aircraft catapult launches, and explosive ordnance deployment. Post-reflow inspection combines 3D automated optical inspection with X-ray computed tomography examining every single solder joint for internal voids, cracks, or anomalies, achieving 100% inspection coverage mandated by military specifications. The boundary-scan testing implementation provides comprehensive interconnect verification and built-in self-test capabilities essential for field maintenance and diagnostic troubleshooting in remote deployment scenarios. Additionally, conformal coating application and hermetic sealing protect assemblies from moisture, fungus, and corrosive environments. This uncompromising process produces electronics with mean time between failures exceeding 500,000 hours, supporting defense systems where failure could result in loss of mission capability or human life.
